This is a starting point for JavaScript solution to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

Welcome to the journey of mastering [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) with CodeCrafters! ðŸš€

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), the backbone of the web, awaits your mastery. In this challenge, you'll embark on a quest to build a robust HTTP/1.1 server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously.

### What to Expect

- **Learn TCP Servers**: Delve into the intricacies of TCP servers and understand how they form the foundation of web communication.
- **HTTP Request Syntax**: Explore the nuances of HTTP request syntax, understanding every bit of the communication protocol that powers the internet.
- **Scalability**: Craft a server that's not just functional but can handle a multitude of requests efficiently.

### Getting Started

To embark on this adventure:

1. **Study the Entry Point**: Navigate to `app/main.js` to uncover the starting point of your HTTP server implementation. Uncomment the relevant code and get ready to kickstart your journey.
2. **Pass the First Stage**: After understanding the code, push your changes to pass the initial stage of the challenge. Execute the following commands:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Pass 1st stage" # Feel free to add any message
   git push origin master
   ```
3. **Onward to the Next Stage**: As you progress through the stages, keep refining your server implementation. Each stage will unlock new insights and challenges, propelling you towards mastery.

### Stage 2 & Beyond

For stages 2 and beyond:

1. **Local Setup**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 18) installed on your local machine.
2. **Run Your Server**: Execute `./your_server.sh` to run your program, implemented in `app/main.js`.
3. **Submission**: Commit your changes and push them to your CodeCrafters repository using `git push origin master`. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

Dive in, embrace the challenge, and emerge as a master of HTTP!
