# Build Your Own [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) Server

Welcome to the repository containing solutions for the ["Build Your Own HTTP server"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) challenge from [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/), implemented in different programming languages.

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) servers in various programming languages. The goal is to provide solutions for the [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) challenge, showcasing how to build a basic HTTP server from scratch.

## Challenge Description

The [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) challenge ["Build Your Own HTTP server"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) aims to test your understanding of networking fundamentals and HTTP protocol. The challenge involves creating an HTTP server that can handle basic HTTP requests such as GET and POST.
